The cymatics generator generates a time-varying 2D interference pattern by summing up sine waves with different frequencies and phase shifts. The GUI allows the user to specify the number of waves, the size of the pattern, the frequency and phase shift of each wave, and the output path where the generated images will be saved. The user can also start and stop the generation process using the "Generate" and "Stop" buttons in the GUI.
